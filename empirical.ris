There are factors inextricably linked to this issue, and one cannot talk about information security in an organization without addressing and understanding the information security culture of that institution. Maximizing the organizational culture within an organization will enable the safeguard of information security. For that, we need to understand which the inhibiting and the enabling factors are.

There have been proposed various reasons for this, ranging from lacking security awareness to the complexity of solutions.

Unfortunately, because a lot of rules configuration work is done manually by the network administrators, misconfigurations are very common and can affect the reliability of the firewall. Identifying such anomalies is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a tree based simulation and verification model to verify if the implemented firewall of a sys

N2  - Small and medium-sized companies typically use the advantages of cloud solutions to run their business; moreover, they can use the cloud to decrease their responsibility. Some of the on-permisses threats can easily eliminate and transform by moving to the cloud environment, but some of the threats will remain. This paper examines the common threats of cloud and third-party services in the SME environment.

N2  - Despite the increased cost of data breaches due to advanced, persistent threats from malicious sources, the adoption of big data security analytics among U.S. small businesses has been slow. Anchored in a diffusion of innovation theory, the purpose of this correlational study was to examine ways to increase the adoption of big data security analytics among small businesses in the United States by examining the relationship between small business leaders’ perceptions of big data security analytics and their

N2  - A cyber-attack can become costly if small businesses are not prepared to protect their information systems or lack the ability to recover from a cybersecurity incident. Small businesses that are not ready to deal with cyber threats are risking significant disruption and loss. In many cases the small business decision makers, owners or managers, do not have a strategy to improve their cybersecurity posture despite the known risk to their business. This research study focused on the relationship between two c

N2  - ICT has become prevalent in our everyday business and personal lives. As such, users and organizations must know how to protect themselves against human errors that lead to more companies losing or sharing information that should not be shared. The issue emanates from lack of ICT security culture both in individuals and organizations. The research study relies on a wide literature review that is centered around proposing a conceptual model of technological, environmental and organizational factors that infl

Due to this lack of resources, small enterprises are experiencing challenges in drafting information security policies as well as monitoring their implementation and compliance levels. This problem can be alleviated by means of a cost effective ”dashboard system” and automated policy generation tool. This paper will critically evaluate an existing policy gen

However, they rarely adopt strategic management planning such as SWOT analysis that considers the external environment for opportunities and threats and internal conditions for strengths and weaknesses.

My study, based on a survey of small and medium business owners or managers, indicates that the resources these businesses need to prevent and bounce back from cyberattacks are available but the decisionmakers may not be aware of them, or may not have implemented the controls properly. The primary question this research seeks to answer is: what are the challenges and the current

Small and medium-sized businesses (SMB) have become victims of cybercrimes and have negatively affected SMBs' cyber hygiene. The continual practice of good cyber hygiene improves and balances the health of business assets such as hardware devices, people, and software applications. To this end, the level of the hygiene of cybersecurity in the SMBs is still not clear. The paper reports the cur

N2  - Cybercrime is on the rise. Attacks by hackers, organized crime and nation-state adversaries are an economic threat for companies world-wide. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have increasingly become victims of cyberattacks in recent years. SMEs often lack the awareness and resources to deploy extensive information security measures. However, the health of SMEs is critical for society: For example, in Germany, 38.8% of all employees work in SMEs, which contributed 31.9% of the German annual gross do

N2  - Given the importance of technologies to organizations, technology leakages can cause considerable financial losses and threaten the survival of firms. Although organizations use technology protection diagnostic models to prevent such leakages, most diagnostic models focus on cybersecurity, and the evaluation system is complex, making it difficult for SMEs to use it. This makes them unsuitable for the general technology protection diagnosis of companies. Hence, this study proposes a diagnostic model that ass
